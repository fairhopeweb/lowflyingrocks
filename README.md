# LowFlyingRocks

A Twitter bot that tweets whenever a Near Earth Object passes the Earth.

It's an Elixir/OTP application, that pulls data from JPL's API and schedules it to be tweeted at the right time.

It's running at [@lowflyingrocks](https://twitter.com/lowflyingrocks)

## Getting Started

You'll need to copy `config/prod.exs.example` to `config/prod.exs`, replacing the oauth tokens with your own.
